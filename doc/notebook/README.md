# Notebook describing issues of interest in: translocation
To view the HTML-rendered notebook directly from this directory (and not instead see the HTML source code when you click on the file), click on the `notebook.nb.html` file and add the prefix `https://htmlpreview.github.io/?` to the URL displayed in the address bar to get: 

`https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/SNARL1/translocation/blob/main/doc/notebook/notebook.nb.html`.

Hit "Return" or "Enter" on your keyboard and the HTML-rendered notebook will appear.

If, after clicking on the notebook file, you see a message that the notebook file is too big to view, click the "View raw" link or "Download" button, and add the address prefix as described above.
