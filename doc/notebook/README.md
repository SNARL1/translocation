# Notebook: translocation

To view the markdown-rendered notebook from GitHub (without having to clone or download the repository), click on the `notebook_translocation.md`(https://github.com/SNARL1/translocation/blob/main/doc/notebook/notebook_translocation.md) file in the `notebook/` directory.

To view the markdown-rendered notebook from RStudio, clone or download the repository and knit the `notebook_results.Rmd` file. 
The resulting markdown file will be available in the `Viewer` tab of the `Files` pane, and from there can be opened in an external window.
