# Code notebooks from: translocation
To view an HTML-rendered notebook directly from this directory (and not instead see the HTML source code when you click on the file), click on the notebook you want 
view and add this prefix to the URL displayed in the address bar: `https://htmlpreview.github.io/?`. For example, for the notebook file 
`translocation_survival_analysis.nb.html`, add `https://htmlpreview.github.io/?` to the notebook's URL

`https://github.com/SNARL1/translocation/blob/main/out/code_notebooks/translocation_survival_analysis.nb.html`

to get 

`https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/SNARL1/translocation/blob/main/out/code_notebooks/translocation_survival_analysis.nb.html`. 

Hit "Return" or "Enter" on your keyboard and the HTML-rendered notebook will appear.

If, after clicking on the notebook file, you see a message that the notebook file is too big to view, click the "View raw" link or "Download" button, and add the address prefix as described above.
