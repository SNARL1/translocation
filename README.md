## Overview of contents

This repository is organized as a reproducible research compendium, and describes frog translocations to reestablish populations of the endangered [mountain yellow-legged frog](https://www.fws.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Mountain-Yellow-Legged-Frog-Conservation-Strategy.pdf). 
It contains data on frog survival following translocations conducted during the period 2006-2020, code to identify predictors of survival using [R](https://www.r-project.org/), a notebook to document project progress to date, and a manuscript (in preparation). 
Throughout this repository, frog populations are referenced only by 5-digit unique site identifiers.
No site names or x-y coordinates are provided to protect these sensitive populations to the maximum extent possible.

This repository contains the following directories and files:

- `code/` directory: `Rmd` files that contain code to create and analyze the project datasets. 
- `data/` directory: Raw data and cleaned data.
- `doc/` directory: Manuscript and notebook files.
- `out/` directory: Output files.
